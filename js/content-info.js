            'description': 'Dogecache is a mobile-first web app inspired by the concept of Geocaching. In the game of Geocaching, people experience scavenger hunts by finding objects that are planted by other players, and at the same time they plant their own objects for people to find. It\'s a game about finding and giving. In Dogecache, people search for dogecoin in their area while giving away dogecoin. By searching the area around them, users can pick up dogecoin within their radius but also has to drop off dogecoin where they are located. This way, dogecoin is always kept in circulation of the Dogecache app, and the game never ends. This app was a hack made at the hackathon at Bergen County Academies. It won the \'Most Polished App\', in addition to \'Best Quality Design App\' by Intel. Dogecache was also given a special invitation to debut at NYC Techday, New York City\'s largest tech startup exhibition.',

This study was made to create a new model that can accurately predict railgun efficiency and performance, because there is no standard model that can effectively determine the output performance of a railgun, this research explored the parameters and factors that affected how a railgun performs, and based on the results made a new equation / model to accurately predict the output efficiency of the railgun\'s projectile. The process involved first solving differential equations to make a predictive/perliminary equations on railgun efficiency, building a railgun from scratch, testing the projectile\'s output efficiency and comparing predictions to results, and finally adjusting the existing preliminary model made specifically to accurately predict railgun efficiency. This research as a part of the Partners in Science program, under the mentorship of Dr. Seongshik Oh at Rutgers University. Technologies used: LabVIEW',

            'description': 'This was a research project done in Fall 2012 - Spring 2013. This project saw the creation of a new type of prosthetic arm for people in developing countries. Standard prosthetic arms, even the simple hook-arms that many amputees use, cost lots of money (thousands of dollars at the least) due to customization needs and investment of time in transitioning to using these often uneasy-to-use gripping mechanisms. Most importantly, prosthetic arms are only dreams to those, especially in developing countries, who lack the money or resources to purchase one. This new prosthetic arm (for below-elbow amputations) has an adjustable mount and an intuitive gripping mechanism, the granular jammer. Granular jamming works by using grains inside a flexible membrane and pressing the membrane against the object. After switching on a vacuum to suck the air out of the membrane, it conforms to the objects shape and can easily grip it. Not only is the arm adjustable to different sizes amputations, but it is easy to use and cost less than 100 dollars to build. This project won 1st place at the Jersey Shore Science Fair, New Jersey Academy of Sciences, Monmouth Junior Science Symposium, and 3rd place at the Delaware Valley Science Fair. This arm design is currently patent-pending.',

            'description': 'This was a research project done in Fall 2011. The study was done to observe the effect of implementing dimples on the surface of a vehicle and how it affects the drag force against the vehicle\'s performance. Two identical pinewood derby cars were the small-scale model vehicles used for the experiment, and each was modified with a layer of clay on top. However, while one car had a smooth surface, the other had a dimpled surface on the clay. The times it took for the dimpled car to reach the finish line were compared to those for the smooth car, and results showed that the dimpled car was able to travel faster than the smooth car, ultimately reducing the drag force that resisted the car\'s motion. This project won 3rd place at the Jersey Shore Science Fair in Physics.',
